# OpenAi-Voice-Enabled-chat-bot
Developed a Python app using the OpenAI API that accepts user queries in speech, converts it into text, sends it to OpenAI for a response, and then uses TTS (Text-to-Speech) to read the response back to the user.<br>
The app is able to capture user speech input.<br>
The app uses speech-to-text conversion to convert user input into text.<br>
The app uses OpenAI API to generate a response to the user query.<br>
The app uses TTS to read the response back to the user in speech format.<br>
The app can handle any errors or exceptions during the process and provide appropriate error messages to the us.<br>
<b>Note: The app is developed using any Python libraries for speech recognition, text-to-speech, and OpenAI API integration.</b> <br>
<b>note: Change API/Engine if it not met your expectation.</b>
