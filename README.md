# OpenAi-Voice-Enabled-chat-bot
Developed a Python app using the OpenAI API that accepts user queries in speech, converts it into text, sends it to OpenAI for a response, and then uses TTS (Text-to-Speech) to read the response back to the user. 
The app is able to capture user speech input.
The app uses speech-to-text conversion to convert user input into text.
The app uses OpenAI API to generate a response to the user query.
The app uses TTS to read the response back to the user in speech format.
The app can handle any errors or exceptions during the process and provide appropriate error messages to the us.

<b>Note: The app is developed using any Python libraries for speech recognition, text-to-speech, and OpenAI API integration.</b>
<b>note: Change API/Engine if it not met your expectation.</b>
